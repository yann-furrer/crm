# Agent — Rules for working on `apps/agent`

The research agent works out who the people in the CRM are. It is an
[eve](https://eve.dev/docs) app, it is **its own deployment**, and it owns every
piece of intelligence in this repo.

Read this with [`api.md`](./api.md) — whose first rule is that none of this may
move into the API — and
[`plan/contact-intelligence-agent.md`](./plan/contact-intelligence-agent.md),
which is why it is shaped this way.

## The framework is the source of truth

The complete eve documentation ships inside the package, matching the installed
version exactly:

```
apps/agent/node_modules/eve/docs/README.md
```

Read the relevant guide there before writing eve code and then check your eve skill knowledge-base shipped in .agents/skills/eve. Guessing at this API is expensive in a specific way: it typechecks, builds, and then behaves differently
from what you assumed — see the note on principal mapping under [the
bridge](#the-bridge).

## The model is a setting, not a deploy

The agent runs on **`zai/glm-5.2-fast`** by default, and a rep can change that
on the settings page without touching the code.

`DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL` lives in [`@crm/db/settings`](../packages/db/src/settings.ts)
because two processes need the same answer — the agent, to compile its
fallback, and the API, to tell the settings page what "Default" resolves to.
A second copy of that string is a second answer to the question.

- **The choice is a row, not an env var.** `AppSetting` holds one record, and
  `agent.ts` resolves it through `defineDynamic` on `session.started` — so a
  change applies to the next session rather than the next deployment, which
  matters in an install whose owner cannot redeploy. A conversation already
  open finishes on the model it started with, and that is deliberate: prompt
  caches are per model, so switching part-way re-ingests the thread at uncached
  prices.
- **The window travels with the id.** eve never inherits
  `modelContextWindowTokens` from the fallback, so `lib/model.ts` always sends
  it. A model with a smaller window than the default would otherwise be
  compacted against a number it does not have, and the turn fails at the
  provider after the context has been assembled and paid for.
- **A failed read degrades, it does not throw.** No row, no database, a
  resolver that raises — all of them leave the compiled fallback in force.
  `lib/model.ts` logs the reason, because the alternative is a session quietly
  running on a model nobody chose.
- **The chooser only offers models this agent can run.** Every read the agent
  has is a tool, so `ModelCatalogService` filters the gateway catalog to
  language models tagged `tool-use`. An unreachable gateway makes the chooser
  read-only rather than failing the page, and the id already stored keeps
  running.
- **Not a frontier model, on purpose.** The hard part of this job is refusing a
  plausible-looking wrong answer, and that is enforced by the tools and the
  evidence model below rather than by model strength. What the job does want is
  a long window — a company preamble hands over every contact on the account —
  and answers fast enough that the sheet's Agent tab reads as a conversation.

## Pictures are copied, never linked

A logo and a profile photograph both arrive as somebody else's URL, and neither
may be stored as one. LinkedIn signs its CDN URLs with an expiry roughly three
weeks out; a brand's own CDN is fine until it is a rate limit on a page drawing
forty logos. Either way the failure is the same and it is the worst shape a
failure can take here — a picture that works today and is a broken image next
month, with nothing to connect the two.

So `mirror()` copies the bytes into Vercel Blob and the record points at our
copy.

**It lives in [`@crm/db/blob`](../packages/db/src/blob.ts), not in the agent.**
It started here, on the reasoning that whoever writes the URL onto the record
should own fetching the bytes — which is still right, and is exactly why it had
to move once more than one thing wrote one. There are four writers now, in three
processes:

| Writer | What it copies |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/brand-images.ts` (agent) | The four artwork columns on a company |
| `lib/portrait.ts` (agent) | A contact's photograph |
| `FaviconService` (API) | The icon a domain's own site serves |
| `ImageMirrorService` (API) | Anything on an existing row still pointing off-site, including a signed-in user's Google avatar |

`packages/db/prisma/seed.ts` is the fifth, and it matters more than it sounds:
demo rows outlive their sources, and a clone seeded today is still open in six
months.

- **The key carries a hash of the bytes.** That is what makes re-running both
  idempotent and correct: unchanged artwork lands on the same URL and the record
  does not move, while a brand that redesigns its mark gets a *new* URL rather
  than the same one behind a month of CDN cache.
- **One list of the columns that hold a picture**, `COMPANY_IMAGE_FIELDS` in
  [`@crm/db/images`](../packages/db/src/images.ts). Four things read it and a
  column missing from one of them is a picture that is never brought in-house,
  with nothing anywhere to say so.
- **It fetches through `@crm/db/safe-fetch`**, which is the favicon resolver's
  own guard, exported rather than copied. The URL came from a vendor's answer
  about a domain a rep typed, so a logo link pointing at `169.254.169.254` is a
  request forgery from inside our network. One copy of that rule, several
  callers.
- **No `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` means no photographs**, and everything else keeps
  the origin's URL. The distinction is deliberate: a face comes from a signed
  CDN link that expires, so storing one would promise a picture that breaks in
  three weeks, while a logo or a favicon merely stays somebody else's to serve.
  It is an optional capability like every other, and it is in
  `lib/capabilities.ts` so the agent is told before it plans.
- **A mirrored URL is what lets the browser optimize it.** `isOptimizable` in
  `@crm/db/images` is the whole of that decision and both halves are load
  bearing: `next.config.ts` allow-lists our Blob host and nothing else, because
  a wildcard would make the deployment an open image proxy — and a mirrored
  *SVG* is still refused, because Blob's separate origin is the only reason we
  store SVG at all, and `/_next/image` would re-serve those bytes from ours.
  Everything that fails the check renders as the plain `<img>` it always was.
- **Faces are not optimized, and that is not an oversight.** `EntityLogo` uses
  `<Image>`; `AvatarImage` deliberately does not. Radix establishes an avatar's
  load state by probing the URL with its own `new window.Image()`, so an
  optimized child would request a second, different URL — two fetches per face
  on a table drawing forty. There is nothing to win for the second one either:
  every photograph we store arrives pre-thumbnailed by its source
  (`shrink_100_100`, `=s96-c`), while brand artwork arrives at whatever size the
  brand publishes.
- **A photograph is only ever taken from a source already tied to this person.**
  `lib/portrait.ts` holds the write and `lib/portrait-sources.ts` holds the
  chain, in order of certainty: their LinkedIn profile, their GitHub account,
  their employer's own team page. Every one is keyed on an identifier already on
  the record, so each asks *what does this account look like* rather than *who
  is this name*.
- **There is no image search by name, and there must never be.** It is the
  obvious fourth step and the one that breaks everything else. A search for
  "Paula Marchetti" returned Brightwater's CEO, an HR lead at Reply and a data
  engineer in Seattle, all confidently — and those were names, which a rep can
  read and smell. Nobody audits a face. Guess where to look, never what you will
  find: a team page is a guess about a URL, and the name printed beside the
  photograph is the answer.
- **`get_linkedin_profile` stores the picture itself** the moment it computes
  `isSamePerson`, in code, rather than asking the model to remember a follow-up
  call.

### Two lanes: what a rep sees, and what a rep asks for

`schedules/dispatch.ts` drains the queue in **two independent lanes**, and which
lane a row lands in is decided by one list — `DIRECT_KINDS` in
[`@crm/db/agent-tasks`](../packages/db/src/agent-tasks.ts).

| | Kinds | How it runs | Per tick |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Visible** | `brand`, `portrait` | Directly, no `receive`, no model | 60, six at a time |
| **Research** | everything else | One eve session per row | 12 |

**Neither kind in the visible lane has anything in it to decide.** A portrait is
three reads keyed on identifiers already on the record and a byte copy. A brand
is a domain in, Context.dev out, map, mirror, write — `lib/brand.ts`, and there
is not one judgement in the whole path. Routing either through a session buys a
context window in order to make no decisions with it.

Routed through a session it also did not work, twice, the same way. Seven queued
faces sat behind sixty LLM sessions at five a minute and had not landed twenty
five minutes later. Then `company-profile` — which is how a logo used to get
fetched — sat at the *bottom* of one shared queue at priority 10, behind every
contact task, so `stripe.com` showed as `stripe.com` in a grey square while the
agent wrote paragraphs about people who worked there.

Lanes are why that cannot recur. A logo does not queue behind research, because
it is not in that queue. `test/lanes.integration.spec.ts` pins it: thirty
`identify` rows do not delay one `brand` row.

The schedule still decides nothing, which is the rule it has to keep. The row
says what the work is; the lane only says whether it needs a conversation.

### Priority is what a rep sees first

One table, in `@crm/db/agent-tasks` because the API writes these and the agent
reads them, and two copies of an ordering is two orderings.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brand` | 900 | the logo and the real name, on every row of the list |
| `portrait` | 800 | the face |
| `workspace` | 500 | who *we* are — every later session opens with it |
| `requested` | 300 | a rep pressed Research |
| `meeting` | 200 | a meeting is coming |
| `identify` | 100 | a new contact |
| `sweep` | 50 | the sign-in backfill |
| `companyProfile` | 40 | the written brief |
| `recheck` | 0 | come back in ninety days |

The top two are the highest on purpose: they are what a rep reads *before*
deciding whether to open anything, they cost one vendor call each, and they
finish in seconds. Everything below is worth a wait; a grey square with initials
in it is not.

`claimDue` sorts what it claims. Postgres does **not** order an `UPDATE …
RETURNING` by the `ORDER BY` of its own sub-select — it returns rows in whatever
order it touched them — so the priority that chose the batch would otherwise be
thrown away at the point the batch is handed to a concurrency-limited pool.

### Starting now instead of on the minute

`POST /internal/crm/dispatch` on the crm channel drains **both lanes** on demand,
and `AgentTriggerService.poke()` calls it after writing *any* `AgentTask` row.
Add a company and its logo appears; add a contact and the research starts. You do
not wait out the cron.

The poke is **fire-and-forget and never awaited**: the `AgentTask` row is still
the message, exactly as [`api.md`](./api.md) requires, and the cron still claims
anything the poke missed. An agent that is down, redeploying or unreachable costs
sixty seconds, not the work.

It used to run the visible lane only, on the reasoning that a lane needing no
`receive` and no session auth keeps eve's principal plumbing out of the route.
That was true and it cost more than it saved, because it made the two lanes
behave differently in the one environment where the cron does not exist. Under
`eve dev` the visible lane ran on every poke and the research lane ran *never* —
so a fresh clone showed every logo resolving within seconds while twenty
`identify` rows sat at `attempts = 0` and `AgentEvent` stayed empty. Nothing
errored. A dead lane is very hard to tell from a slow one when the lane beside it
is visibly working.

So the route starts sessions too. It calls the channel's own `send` rather than
`receive`, since it is already *on* the crm channel — `receive` is for handing
work to a different one. The principal comes from `APP_AUTH` in
[`lib/app-auth.ts`](../apps/agent/agent/lib/app-auth.ts), which is the one copy of
eve's app principal in this repo: `lib/approval.ts` already hard-coded those three
strings to decide whether a turn may write unattended, and eve does not export
`SCHEDULE_APP_AUTH` publicly. `taskAuth()` builds the attributes both callers
need, so the schedule and the route cannot drift on what a session is told about
its task. The schedule still passes eve's own `appAuth` where it has it.

**Both callers go through `drainAll`, and it collapses.** The cron ran alone once
a minute, so overlap was never a question it had to answer; the poke fires per
enqueued row, and a sync creating forty contacts calls it forty times in a few
seconds. `claimDue` hands each caller a *disjoint* batch, so without a guard that
is forty research sessions at once instead of the twelve a minute the cron
allows — a cost and rate-limit spike triggered by nothing more than a busy inbox.
`collapsing()` in [`lib/pool.ts`](../apps/agent/agent/lib/pool.ts) keeps one drain
in flight and folds everything that arrives during it into a single trailing run,
so work queued mid-drain is still picked up immediately rather than waiting out
the next tick. It is per-process: cross-process overlap stays the job of leases
and `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, which already handle it.

`AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` authorises it, and **unset means the route refuses rather
than opens**, the same rule the rep bridge follows.

### Checking a key belongs to the person who typed it

`POST /internal/crm/verify-key` is the crm channel's second internal route, and
it exists because the API is not allowed to call Context.dev and this agent
already does. It takes a candidate key, probes with it, and answers `valid`,
`invalid` or `unknown` — no session, no model, no task row, because there is
nothing here to decide.

- **The probe is free and it is chosen to be.** A brand lookup only bills when
  it resolves a brand, and a free-provider address is refused with a documented
  `422` first, so `key-check@gmail.com` authenticates without buying anything.
  Do not "improve" this to a real domain: that is ten credits every time
  somebody saves a key, including every time they correct a typo.
- **`classifyKey` rejects on `401` and nothing else.** Every other status came
  back *after* the key was accepted, so it says something about the plan, the
  quota or Context's afternoon — not about the key. Treating a `429` as a bad
  key would refuse a perfectly good one at the worst possible moment.
- **It is the candidate key, never the stored one.** `verifyKey` builds a
  throwaway client from the argument, so checking a new key cannot be confused
  with exercising the one already saved.

The API's half is `ResearchKeyService`, and an `unknown` answer there saves the
key anyway — see
[the environment rules](./environment.md#the-context-key-is-asked-for-not-configured).

### Catching up what was missed

Enrichment is queued when a record is created, so anything created before a
capability existed never gets it. Two routes, and picking the wrong one is
expensive:

| | Covers | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automatic sweep, on sign-in | Records never successfully looked up | Ten credits per company |
| `ImageMirrorService`, in the same sweep | Rows whose picture is still served from somebody else's origin | Nothing |
| `bun run --filter=agent backfill:images` | Records already enriched, missing only the *pictures* | Nothing |

The middle row is the one that keeps "every picture is ours" true rather than
true-since-Tuesday. Every writer copies as it writes, but that says nothing
about rows written before it did, or rows whose copy failed at the time because
the origin was down. Left alone those never resolve, and nothing looks broken —
the pictures render perfectly, off someone else's server, forever. It is capped
at twenty five rows per table per sweep, so a backlog drains over several
sign-ins instead of in one burst that looks like a scrape.

**A photo sweep queues anyone with a LinkedIn URL, a GitHub URL, or an employer
with a website — the three doors the chain knows. The third reads the company's
team page and costs Context.dev credits, which is why a **finished `portrait`
task stands that contact down for thirty days**. Most people are not on their
employer's team page and never will be; without the stand-down every sweep would
pay to re-read the same sites and find the same nothing, forever. The task's
`outcome` carries what was actually tried, so a month of paid lookups leaves
something readable behind.

The sweep has no button, deliberately.** It had one on each list page, and a
control whose correct usage is "press it whenever you notice blanks" is a chore
dressed as a feature — a rep has no way of knowing which records predate the
favicon resolver, and no business fixing that by hand.

The trigger is **signing in**, which is the one moment nothing else in the app
can see. `packages/auth` owns it, through a Better Auth
`databaseHooks.session.create.after`; `BackfillService.onModuleInit` subscribes
via `onSignedIn`. The registry exists because the arrow cannot point the other
way — `@crm/auth` is a dependency of the API, so it must not import a Nest
provider — and it means the Next.js app, which imports the package only to read
sessions, runs none of this.

`BackfillService` has no router at all as a result. Nothing calls it; it is
subscribed. A five-minute stand-down collapses a burst — a team arriving at
nine, or Google linking an account mid-sign-in — and `auto()` returns before any
work starts, so nothing is between a person and their CRM.

It writes `AgentTask` rows and decides nothing, which is what keeps it on the
API's side of the line in [`api.md`](./api.md); whether a given company is worth
the credits stays the agent's call. Each pass is capped at 500 rows and the
leftover is logged rather than rounded away.

**The cap is on the pass, not on each query inside it.** A company sweep has two
sets of candidates — never successfully looked up, and still missing its
artwork — and it used to take 500 of each and hand the union to `backfill`, so
one sign-in could enqueue a thousand `brand` rows at priority 900 and fill the
[direct lane](#two-lanes-what-a-rep-sees-and-what-a-rep-asks-for) with twice the
declared budget. The union is deduplicated and cut to 500 before it is queued,
and `remaining` is counted against the union in one query — the two sets overlap
heavily, since a company that was never looked up rarely has a logo — so the
figure the log prints is the work actually left rather than the leftover of one
of the two halves.

The script is the cheap half: it re-derives from the `CompanyEnrichment.raw`
payloads already on disk, which is what keeping them was for. Reach for it when
the records are fine and only the images are missing.

## Evidence, not confidence

**No tool accepts a confidence, a score, or a `sourceUrl` offered as proof.** A
tool reports what it *observed* — `crm.signature-block`, `github.account-identity`
— and `lib/evidence.ts` prices it. This is the rule the whole design rests on:
a model asked to grade its own certainty will, and it will be wrong in the
direction that makes it look useful.

- `lib/evidence.ts` — the weights, the combination rule, the bands.
- `lib/facts.ts` — the only write path to a contact's fields. Applies at
  `VERIFIED`, stores a proposal below it, and enforces three things a prompt
  cannot: never overwrite a human, never re-offer a dismissal, never write
  without a primary source.
- The bands are behaviour, not labels. `PROBABLE` means *a rep decides*, and
  that is a correct outcome — four Marchettis work at Fernhill.

Adding a fact field means adding it to `FIELDS` in `lib/facts.ts` **and** to
`FACT_COLUMNS` in `apps/api/src/contacts/contacts.service.ts`, which is where an
accepted proposal writes through.

## Optional by default

Every outside source is optional and the agent is designed to run with none.
`lib/capabilities.ts` is the single place that knows what is set: it prints the
list at boot, states it in the session instructions so the agent plans around
what it has, and gives tools a shared "not configured, and retrying will not
help" result — checked **before** the research budget is charged.

A missing key removes a place to look. It is never an error, and it must never
throw.

**Not all of them are environment variables, which is why `capabilities()` is
async.** The Context.dev key is a row a rep can set on Settings → General — see
[the environment rules](./environment.md#the-context-key-is-asked-for-not-configured)
— so the answer to *what can I use here* now involves a read, and `enabled()`
and `capabilitiesMarkdown()` are awaited with it. `capabilitiesFrom()` and
`markdownFor()` are the pure halves, which is what keeps
`test/capabilities.spec.ts` a unit test rather than something that reports a
different answer depending on what the developer happens to have saved locally.

`contextDevKey()` is the only resolver, and `lib/context-dev.ts` builds its
client from it rather than from `process.env` — memoised on the key string, so
replacing the key swaps the client and nothing else does. There is no cache in
front of the read: a key saved in the browser applies to the next vendor call,
not the next deploy.

## Budget, and deciding what to do next

- `lib/focus.ts` holds the per-session budget in `defineState`. Every vendor
  call charges it. Running out is a normal ending.
- `lib/tasks.ts` is the work queue. `claimDue` leases rows with
  `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, so two dispatchers take disjoint work and a run that
  dies frees its row when the lease expires.
- `schedules/dispatch.ts` is the **only** schedule. It decides nothing: it
  leases what is due and starts a session per row. Anything that looks like
  "every N minutes, the oldest ten contacts" belongs in a task's `dueAt`, not in
  a cron expression.
- `tools/schedule_recheck.ts` is how the agent books its own next look, and its
  `reason` is shown to the rep. An agent that cannot say why it will be back in
  fourteen days does not have a reason, it has a default.

## Three records, and no dead ends between them

The CRM has contacts, companies and deals, and the agent is opened on any of
them. Every read hands back the **ids** of the neighbouring records, and that
rule is not decoration — the two worst answers this agent has given both came
from breaking it:

> I don't have a tool that lists contacts by company, only ones that look up a
> specific contact by ID or email. Could you paste the contact's name or email
> address?

Said to a rep who had the company open, with the contacts on screen. The
company preamble reported a *count* of contacts, the only read took a
`contactId`, and the agent correctly concluded it had nowhere to go. And, on a
contact who plainly worked somewhere, that no company was available: the
history returned `companyName`, a display string, while every company tool
takes an id.

So:

| Read | Free | Hands back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read_crm_history` | yes | the contact's **company id**, the deals they are on, their colleagues |
| `read_company_history` | yes | **every contact with their id**, every deal, the account's threads and meetings, the notes |
| `read_deal_history` | yes | the stage clock, every stage it moved through, the people on it with ids, the last reply |
| `search_crm` | yes | contacts, companies and deals matching what a person would type |

**A preamble or a tool result that names a record without its id is a bug**,
because the only recovery available to the agent is to ask the human — which is
the CRM handing its own join back to the person using it. Ambiguity is
different, and fine: four Marchettis come back as four rows with their titles,
and asking which one is a question rather than a chore.

`search_crm` deliberately does no fuzzy matching. "Northwind" reaching
"Northwind Savings Group" is useful; "Marchetti" reaching "Marchetta" is a
wrong record in a CRM, and a wrong record about a real person is the one
failure this whole design exists to prevent.

### A session is a conversation, and they are not all the same one

`lib/preamble.ts` builds what a session is told before it speaks, and it varies
on two axes:

- **Which record.** A person is asked who they are, a company what it does and
  who we know there, a deal where it stands. Each preamble names that record's
  neighbours, with ids, and points at the read to start from.
- **Who opened it.** A dispatched task is a research pass with a budget; a rep
  in the sheet is a conversation. Told neither, the agent assumed the first,
  which is how a question got a work plan back. `taskKind` is the tell — the
  dispatcher sets it and the panel never does.

The prose lives in `lib/preamble.ts` rather than in `instructions/task.ts` so
that `test/preamble.integration.spec.ts` can assert the thing that actually
matters: that a company session can name its own contacts. `task.ts` is the
resolver, and it owns the one side effect — seeding `lib/focus.ts`, without
which the audit hook files a session's events against nothing.

Adding a fourth record kind is an entry in `sessionPreamble`, a read beside the
other three, and a line in `TOOL_VERBS` (`apps/app/lib/agent-transcript.ts`),
which a test enforces so no tool ever shows a rep a bare slug.

### Every session also knows who *we* are

A research agent that knows everything about the person and nothing about the
company employing it writes a dossier, not a briefing. Asked about a contact
before a call it returned six accurate paragraphs on him and could not say what
any of it meant for us, because nothing had ever told it what we sell.

So `composeClosing()` puts a **Who we are** block in front of the capabilities
in *every* preamble — contact, company, deal, and the record-less one — and
`lib/workspace.ts` is the only thing that renders it.

- **It is deliberately tiny**, and the write path enforces that rather than the
  prompt asking nicely: 320 characters of narrative and one short line each for
  what we sell, who we sell to, and what we are picked over (`MAX_NARRATIVE` and
  `MAX_LINE` in [`@crm/db/workspace`](../packages/db/src/workspace.ts)). It rides
  in front of every question a rep asks, so a page of it would crowd out the
  record they are actually asking about — and it is prompt-cached, so it is paid
  for once and then read on every turn forever.
- **It says what the context is for.** "Say what this record means for us — a
  fit, a competitor, a partner, or nothing worth saying — and never write a
  pitch: the rep already knows what we sell." Without that line the model has
  the facts and no instruction, and starts selling our own product back to us.
- **A workspace with no profile still gets the name line**, followed by *do not
  guess at what we sell*. The failure mode of the alternative is a confident
  invention drawn from our customers' industries.
- **The profile belongs to a website, and dies with it.**
  `readWorkspaceIdentity` returns the profile only when its `website` still
  matches the workspace's. Change the website and the block silently drops to
  the name line until the new one is researched, rather than describing the
  company we used to be.
- **It is not a `Company` row.** A self company would need excluding from every
  list, facet, sweep and join in the app — the always-the-same-`organizationId`
  trap from [`api.md`](./api.md) wearing a different hat. It is one row in
  `WorkspaceProfile`, keyed on `WORKSPACE_ID`, which is why that constant now
  lives in `@crm/db` and `@crm/auth` re-exports it: the agent has no dependency
  on the auth package and there must not be a second copy of the string.

The research pass is a `workspace-profile` task with no `contactId` and no
`companyId`, dispatched like everything else. Its preamble sends the session to
our own site with `web_fetch` — no vendor credits — and `write_workspace_profile`
is the only way to file the result. `WorkspaceService.update` queues it when the
website changes, and the sign-in sweep queues it when a website has no profile
behind it, which covers the install that filled the settings page in before any
of this existed and the one whose first attempt failed.

**A finished attempt stands the sweep down for seven days**, the same shape as
the portrait stand-down above and for the same reason. There is one workspace,
so a website that cannot be read into a profile — a holding page, a site that
blocks the fetch — was a `workspace-profile` session queued on *every* sign-in
sweep for the life of the install, at the highest research priority there is,
never getting a different answer. Changing the website still queues one
immediately through `WorkspaceService.update`, so the stand-down only paces the
retry of a failure, and it is shorter than a contact's thirty days because this
one row rides in front of every question a rep asks.

## What the agent may read, and what may leave

It may read **everything**, including full email bodies — single-tenant internal
tool, and a signature block is the best source of a job title there is. The
boundary is egress, and it is three rules:

1. No customer text in a third-party query. Derived questions only.
2. Nothing from a mailbox into `/workspace`. The sandbox has a different
   lifetime.
3. Nothing sensitive logged. Reading is not logging.

`skills/data-boundaries.md` is the agent's copy of this. Keep them in step.

## The sandbox

`agent/sandbox/sandbox.ts` turns on `bash`, the file tools, and a `/workspace`,
with **`deny-all` egress** set on the backend factory so it cannot be forgotten
per session. That costs nothing: `web_fetch` runs in the app runtime and
`web_search` at the model provider, so retrieval is unaffected.

**Never give the sandbox `DATABASE_URL`.** CRM access is authored tools in the
app runtime. A shell with credentials and network is exfiltration-shaped even in
an internal tool; a shell with neither is a text processor.

## The bridge

The contact sheet's **Agent** tab talks to a running agent. The path:

```
browser  →  /eve/v1/*  (same origin, session cookie)
              + x-crm-contact: the record the rep has open
         →  apps/app/app/eve/v1/[...path]/route.ts
              checks the Better Auth session
              strips the cookie
              mints a 2-minute HS256 token naming the rep
              and carrying the contact id
         →  AGENT_URL/eve/v1/*
              agent/channels/eve.ts → repFromCrm() verifies it
              instructions/task.ts reads attributes.contactId
```

**The record travels in the token, never in the message.** The panel used to
prefix everything a rep typed with `About contact <cuid> (Name):` so the agent
knew what it was looking at, which meant the rep read their own question back
with plumbing bolted to the front. The claim reaches the agent through the same
`session.auth.attributes` path the dispatcher uses, so the message stays theirs.

Mounted at `/eve/v1/*` deliberately: that is where `useEveAgent()` looks by
default, so the hook needs no `host` and there is no CORS and no cross-site
cookie anywhere in it. It is the same trade the app already makes for the API.

Three things worth knowing before you touch it:

- **The proxy is an enforcement point, not a passthrough.** The agent never sees
  the session cookie, so if that route did not check the session, nothing
  downstream would.
- **eve's `jwtHmac()` helper resolves an HMAC token to
  `principalType: "service"`** with a namespaced `principalId`. Correct for a
  machine credential, wrong for a person — and `lib/approval.ts` decides whether
  to pause for a human by reading exactly those fields, so a rep would have been
  refused a sensitive write while sitting there watching. `repFromCrm` wraps
  `verifyJwtHmac` and maps the subject to a real user principal.
  `test/channel-auth.spec.ts` pins it.
- **`AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` unset skips the auth entry rather than opening it.**
  The panel stops working; the agent keeps running its own schedule. An
  optional capability's absence must never widen access.

### The panel knows which record it is on

`lib/agent-record.ts` is the single place that maps a record kind to everything
downstream: the header the panel sends, the claim the proxy mints, the field a
conversation is filed under, and the questions offered on an empty thread. A
contact is asked "Who is this person?", a company "What do they do?", a deal
"Where does this stand?" — offering the first of those on a company is the tell
that a chat box was bolted on rather than built into the record.

The agent gets the same context: `instructions/task.ts` opens a session with a
preamble built from the record, so a deal session starts knowing the stage, the
amount, the close date and who is on it, rather than spending its first two tool
calls finding out.

Adding a fourth kind is one entry in `COPY` plus a branch in the agent's
preamble — not four edits in four layers.

### Conversations are kept

A record accumulates conversations, and they survive a reload. `AgentConversation`
holds the *handle* — the durable eve session id plus its cursor — while the
transcript itself is already in `AgentEvent`, written by the audit hook. Nothing
is stored twice.

- **Resuming.** The panel passes the saved cursor as `initialSession`, so
  reopening a contact continues last week's thread rather than starting another.
  eve keeps sessions for 30 days.
- **Replay from the start.** `streamIndex: 0` on resume, deliberately — the
  saved index is where the *last reader* stopped, and a reopened thread should
  show what was said in it, not only what has happened since.
- **Which thread is open lives in the URL** (`?thread=`), like every other view
  state in the sheet, so a refresh keeps your place and a conversation is a link.
  It is cleared when the record or the tab changes, by the same rule that drops
  a half-typed quick-add form.
- **Nothing mounts until the list has loaded.** Rendering a thread while the
  history is still in flight starts a *new* eve session and then remounts onto
  the real one — which presents as "the history only appears if I refresh".
- **The thread the panel landed on is captured once.** Re-deriving "the latest"
  as the list changes would swap the open conversation out from under a live
  answer the moment the first save adds a row. `resolveThread` in
  `lib/agent-transcript.ts` holds the rule, and it is tested.
- **The panel is not unmounted when you switch tabs.** It holds a live stream,
  and Radix drops an inactive tab by default — which aborts the stream
  mid-answer, so the reply landed in the durable session with nothing attached
  to receive it. That is the "I went to another tab and the answer never came
  back" bug, and no amount of re-reading state on the way in could fix it,
  because the events had been dropped. `keepMounted` on the tab descriptor
  (`detail-sheet.tsx`) keeps it alive; it renders nothing until the tab is
  opened once, so flicking through records costs nothing.
- **A thread is loaded with `session.snapshot()`, not by hand.** One call
  returns the complete event prefix, the cursor that continues from it, and a
  continuation token *if and only if* eve will accept another turn — about 30ms
  against a hundred-event thread. `lib/agent-session.ts` is the whole of it.

  What it replaced is worth remembering, because every panel bug of the last
  day came out of it: a raw `fetch` of `…/stream?startIndex=-1`, parsing the
  last line into a state machine. The endpoint *follows*, so awaiting the body
  never returned. The stream opens with a bare newline, so "the first line" was
  empty — which failed closed to "busy" and locked **every** reopened
  conversation with "still working on the last question", including ones parked
  with a perfectly good token. And a read that failed reported the *session* as
  working rather than reporting itself as broken, so it could never recover.
  The framework had a documented answer to the exact question that code was
  asking. Read the guide before hand-rolling the protocol.
- **The token is the authority on whether a message can be sent**, not our
  reading of the events. eve returns one only when the captured prefix ends
  parked, which is precisely the condition under which the next send lands.
- **A turn that has gone quiet for 90 seconds is over, not working.** A
  restarted agent leaves sessions with no closing boundary; they never park, and
  treating them as in-flight locks that thread forever.
- **An unreachable agent is `offline`, not `working`.** One is a fact about us
  and the other a claim about the session; stated as the latter it is both
  untrue and unrecoverable, since the read fails identically next time. The
  transcript then comes from our own `AgentEvent` archive — which is also what
  makes a thread older than eve's 30-day retention still readable — and the
  composer stays usable.
- **An ended thread gets a button, not a locked box.** Ended and working both
  disable the composer and mean completely different things: one is a wait of
  seconds, the other is permanent. `composerState()` keeps them apart, and an
  ended thread offers **Start a new conversation**, which moves the picker to a
  new thread. The transcript stays on screen throughout, and the save hook
  treats the fresh session as a new conversation by comparing session ids
  rather than by whether the panel started empty.
- **`autoScroll` and nothing else.** The scroller is a state machine
  (`following-bottom`, `free-scrolling`, `anchored-to-message`) and
  `scrollAnchor` selects the third, which *stops it following the bottom* — the
  answer then streams below the fold while the modes fight over each new row.
  Left alone, `autoScroll` follows the tail while the reader is at the bottom
  and releases the moment they scroll away, which lights the jump-to-end button.
- **One `MessageScrollerItem` per message, not per part.** The row is what the
  scroller measures; a row per tool call adds a boundary every few hundred
  milliseconds during an answer. Part ids prefer `toolCallId`, which is stable
  across a call's streaming states.
- **A thread nobody has spoken in is loaded from nothing.** The snapshot query
  is disabled without a conversation; a brand-new thread mounts with no session
  and no events, and its first message creates both.
- **Scoped to the rep.** Two people asking about the same contact are having two
  conversations. `ConversationsService` filters on the caller, and a session id
  in a request body decides which row, never whose.
- **Cached the way `api.md` prescribes**: read through
  `cache-manager` (Redis when `REDIS_URL` is set), write on miss, explicit
  invalidation on every save. The list is read on every sheet open and changes
  only when somebody sends a message, which is the shape a cache is for.

This lives in the API rather than the agent, and that is not a breach of rule
one: listing a record's history researches nothing, scores nothing and decides
nothing. The agent owns judgement; the data surface owns filing.

### Turning it on

Same value in both processes, from the one root `.env`:

```sh
AGENT_URL="http://127.0.0.1:2000"        # the default
AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

Then `bun run dev` (the agent serves on `:2000`) and open any contact.

**If the Agent tab errors:**

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| `503`, "not configured for this install" | `AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` is unset in the app's process |
| `401` | The two processes hold *different* secrets |
| `502`, "not reachable" | The agent is not running, or `AGENT_URL` is wrong |

`eve dev` takes about five seconds to bind, and it listens on **IPv4 only**.
That is why `AGENT_URL` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:2000` rather than
`http://localhost:2000`: Node resolves `localhost` to `::1` first, so the
`localhost` form fails to connect on a machine where the agent is plainly
running — and reports itself as "not reachable", which sends you looking in the
wrong place.

A variable in `.env` is not enough on its own: Turbo runs in strict env mode, so
`apps/app/turbo.json` and `apps/agent/turbo.json` both declare the pair in
`passThroughEnv`. Adding a variable and not declaring it produces exactly the
`401` above.

### Checking it without a browser

`localDev()` accepts anything on loopback, so a bare `curl` to `127.0.0.1`
proves nothing about the bridge. Send a non-loopback `Host` to make that entry
skip:

```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' \
  -H 'Host: agent.example.com' \
  http://127.0.0.1:2000/eve/v1/info                      # 401

curl -s -H 'Host: agent.example.com' \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:2000/eve/v1/info | jq '.tools.available | length'
```

`GET /eve/v1/info` is the whole inventory — tools, skills, schedules, channels,
sandbox, and a `diagnostics` count that is the fastest way to find a file eve
silently ignored.

## Watching it work

`eve dev` shows every tool call, every result and every token — but only in its
interactive TUI, and under `bun run dev` that TUI is unreadable. Turbo gives each
task a pty, so eve believes it owns a terminal and paints a full-screen UI into a
pane that turbo is also drawing; the two redraws interleave and what a rep of the
agent's work actually looks like is `Building your agent compiling
agent[agent] on  LinkedIn (RAPIDAPI_KEY)`. The prompt at the bottom is real and
you cannot type at it usefully either.

So **`dev` is `eve dev --no-ui`**, and `dev:tui` keeps the interactive one for
when you run the agent on its own and want to talk to it. `--no-ui` changes
nothing about the server — same port, same routes, same watcher — it only stops
eve taking over the terminal, which is the whole of the problem.

That leaves nothing narrating the session, and `hooks/activity.ts` is that
narration: a line per tool call with its arguments, a line per result with how
long it took, the finish reason and token spend of each step, and any failure
with its code.

- **The lines go to stderr, not stdout.** The TUI's default log mode is `stderr`
  and it keeps stdout buffered and hidden, so a `console.log` here would be
  invisible in the mode it exists to serve. Written to stderr the same lines show
  under `--no-ui`, under the TUI, and in `eve logs`.
- **Contents print outside production; the shape prints everywhere.** Which tool
  ran, whether it worked, what it cost — none of that is anybody's data, so it
  logs wherever the agent runs. Arguments and replies carry names, addresses and
  whatever a rep typed, which is the "nothing sensitive logged" rule above, so
  they are gated on `NODE_ENV`. In production the durable record is an
  `AgentEvent` row, not a log drain.
- **It is not the audit trail.** `hooks/audit.ts` writes every event to
  `AgentEvent` whatever this prints, and the panel's transcript is read back from
  there. A change to one is not a change to the other.
- **A call is timed by remembering it, because the result event does not carry
  the tool name or a duration.** The map of in-flight calls is bounded rather
  than trusted: a turn that dies between request and result would otherwise leak
  an entry per call, forever, in a process that stays up for days.

`eve logs` reads the full record back, but only for an **interactive** `eve dev`
— that is the process that writes `.eve/logs/`. Under `--no-ui` the pane is the
record, so keep the turbo scrollback rather than going looking for a file that
was never written.

Two consequences of running headless, both worth recognising rather than
debugging:

- **A second `bun run dev` fails the whole turbo run.** An interactive `eve dev`
  reconnects to a local server that is already up; a headless one rejects it and
  exits non-zero, and turbo then tears down the other tasks in *that*
  invocation — the first one keeps running untouched. `A dev server is already
  running for this eve agent` means exactly what it says: you already have one.
  Use the terminal it is in, or stop it before starting another.
- **An orphaned agent holds the port.** If turbo dies without reaping its child,
  nothing on screen says so and every later `bun run dev` fails the same way.
  `lsof -nP -iTCP:2000 -sTCP:LISTEN` names the process to kill.

### Nothing is researching, and the queue only grows

**`eve dev` never fires schedules on their cron cadence.** It is one line in
eve's own [schedules guide](../apps/agent/node_modules/eve/docs/schedules.mdx),
and it used to be the single most confusing thing about working on this agent,
because every visible part of the loop worked: the Research button wrote its
`AgentTask` row, the sheet said *Queued*, the toast promised the page would
update — and `schedules/dispatch.ts`, the only thing that turns a row into a
session, was never called. Twenty rows sat with `attempts = 0` and `AgentEvent`
was empty. Nothing was broken and nothing reported a problem, because nothing
ran.

**The poke is what makes dev behave like production now**, which is most of why
it was widened to both lanes — see [starting now](#starting-now-instead-of-on-the-minute).
A row written by the API is dispatched immediately whatever the clock is doing,
so the schedule is a backstop rather than the only door.

**It only does that when `AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` is set**, and that variable is
optional: `poke()` reads it first and returns without sending anything when it is
unset. So an install that has not set it is back at the paragraph above with no
cron behind it either — rows queue, nothing dispatches, and the queue looks
exactly like a slow agent. Set it, or run the dispatch below by hand.

That leaves two cases where the clock's absence bites even with the poke
working, and both look identical to the above: **a task the API did not
write** — `schedule_recheck`,
which books its own `dueAt` weeks out — and **anything queued while the agent was
down**, since a missed poke is not retried. For those, the dev server mounts a
one-shot route that runs the exact dispatch path production cron uses:

```sh
bun run --filter=agent dispatch
# {"scheduleId":"dispatch","sessionIds":["wrun_01KZ…", …]}
```

It drains **both lanes**, exactly as the cron does: up to `VISIBLE_BATCH` (60)
`brand` and `portrait` rows six at a time, handled in the process with no session
at all, and `RESEARCH_BATCH` (12) research rows, one session each. So the
`sessionIds` it prints are the research rows only — a run that resolved forty
logos prints an empty list and was not idle. Either way it spends real credits, a
vendor call per visible row and a model session per research one; that is the
point of it, and the reason it is a command you run rather than a ticker somebody
leaves on. Watch the agent pane; the session ids it returns are also streamable at
`GET /eve/v1/session/:id/stream`.

`eve start` on a built app *does* run the schedule, and so does Vercel, where
each `defineSchedule` becomes a Cron Job. Dev is the only place the clock is
missing.

### The continuation token you write is not the one you read

**eve namespaces a continuation token with the channel's name.** `channels/crm.ts`
mints `task:<id>`; by the time `session.waiting` hands it back on the channel
context it is `crm:task:<id>`. The `eve` channel's own sessions read back as
`eve:<uuid>` for the same reason.

This is worth stating because of how it failed, which was silently and
completely. `taskToken()` used to mint `crm:task:<id>` itself, so the handler was
matching `startsWith("crm:task:")` against `crm:crm:task:<id>`, getting `null`,
and returning before `completeTask`. Nothing errored. The research ran, facts
were written, briefs were saved, and the agent pane showed a clean session — but
**no task ever reached `finishedAt`**, so every contact sat on "Researching"
forever and the sweep re-queued work that had already been done. Twenty-eight
tasks, zero finished.

Two things made it survive a reading:

- **The event data and the channel accessor disagree.** `session.waiting`'s
  `data.continuationToken` carries the token *as stored* — un-namespaced — while
  `channel.continuationToken` carries it namespaced. Debugging from the archived
  event says the token is fine, because from that angle it is.
- **Nothing downstream depends on settling.** The record's status is the only
  thing that notices, and "still researching" is indistinguishable from
  "researching slowly" until you look at `attempts` in the table.

So `taskFromToken` keys on the `task:` marker rather than a fixed prefix, which
reads correctly whoever namespaced it and still settles sessions parked before
the fix. `test/crm-token.spec.ts` pins all three forms.

The general rule: **a channel handler must not assume the token it receives is
byte-identical to the one it sent.** Parse for your own marker.

## Tests

`bun run --filter=agent test`. The integration specs need `DATABASE_URL` and run
against a real Postgres, which is the point — "never overwrite a human" is only
true if the transaction says so.
