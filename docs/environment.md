# Environment

## One `.env`, at the root of the repo

Copy [`.env.example`](../.env.example) to `.env` and fill in the five required
values. That file is the documentation — every variable the repo reads is in it,
with a note on what it does, and nothing that is not read is in it.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

It is loaded by [`packages/env`](../packages/env), which walks up from the
process's working directory to the workspace root and reads `.env`, then
`.env.local` on top. Every process gets there:

| Process | How it picks the file up |
| --- | --- |
| The NestJS API | `@crm/db` and `@crm/auth` both `import "@crm/env/load"` before reading anything |
| The Next.js app | `next.config.ts` calls `loadRootEnv()`, then republishes `API_URL` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` |
| The agent | `agent/agent.ts` and `@crm/db` |
| The Prisma CLI | `packages/db/prisma.config.ts` |

**Real environment variables always win.** The loader never overwrites a value
already present in `process.env`, so a platform's own configuration — Vercel,
Docker, systemd, CI — takes precedence and the file is purely a local
convenience. With no `.env` at all the loader is a no-op and each consumer
reports by name what it is missing.

There used to be four files (`apps/api/.env`, `apps/app/.env`,
`packages/db/.env`, `apps/agent/.env`), three of which had to hold identical
copies of `DATABASE_URL` and `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`. Files that must agree are
files that can disagree, and the failure was not an error: the API would mint a
session cookie the app could not verify, so the browser bounced between
`/sign-in` and `/` forever. If you still have those files from an older
checkout, delete them.

### Finding the root

The marker is a `package.json` that declares `workspaces` — the one thing only
the root has. Neither obvious alternative works: every package has a
`package.json`, and `apps/api` and `apps/agent` have their own `turbo.json`. A
walk that stops at the first `turbo.json` resolves the API's root to
`apps/api`, reads a file that is not there, and the symptom surfaces three
frames away as a missing variable. `packages/env/test/root.spec.ts` pins this.

## What is required

Three values, and the API refuses to start without them.

| Variable | Why it has no default |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `docker compose up -d` starts a Postgres that matches `.env.example` exactly |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Signs session cookies. `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `ALLOWED_SIGN_IN` | The entire authorisation model — see below |

Everything else has a working localhost default or is genuinely optional. That
is the difference between a clone that runs and a clone that makes you read a
table of variables first.

### Google is the fourth value, and it is a pair

`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are what a clone starts with, and
almost every install wants them: they are both the sign-in button and the Gmail
and Calendar sync. They are nonetheless **optional**, because an install that
signs in through [its own identity provider](./api.md#sso-is-a-row-not-a-deployment)
should not have to create a Google Cloud project to do it.

- **They are set together or not at all.** `packages/auth/src/env.ts` throws on
  one without the other, because half a client is a sign-in button that fails at
  Google with an error the reader cannot act on.
- **Neither Google nor a provider is a state the sign-in page reports**, naming
  the two variables — see [the SSO rules](./api.md#sso-is-a-row-not-a-deployment).
  It is the one configuration mistake whose audience is the person who can fix
  it, so it must not present as a blank page.
- **Without them, Gmail sync is a capability the install does not have**, and
  Settings → Connections says so rather than offering a button that cannot work.

### `ALLOWED_SIGN_IN`

Who may sign in, comma-separated, each entry either a whole email domain or a
single address:

```sh
ALLOWED_SIGN_IN="acme.com"                       # everyone at a workspace
ALLOWED_SIGN_IN="acme.com,contractor@gmail.com"  # …plus one outsider
ALLOWED_SIGN_IN="you@gmail.com"                  # a one-person install
```

Bare addresses exist for the third case: a solo self-hoster on a consumer
mailbox has no domain to name, and `gmail.com` would be an open door.

One list, read by two things that must never disagree — the sign-in guard and
the sync's decision about which side of a conversation is external. If they
drifted, a colleague's address would either be refused at the door or filed as
a sales lead.

**An empty list fails closed**: nobody signs in until it is set. The other
choice would be a CRM full of real customer data that any Google account can
read, and it would look like it was working. It is parsed on demand rather than
at import, so the Better Auth CLI — which loads `auth.ts` in a process with no
`.env` — and the tests can both set it themselves.

Live in `packages/auth/src/workspace.ts`.

## The landing page is a flag, and it is off

`IS_MARKETING="true"` serves the landing page in `app/(landing)` at `/`.
Anything else — unset, empty, `false`, `1` — and a signed-out visitor to the
root is redirected to `/sign-in`.

It defaults to off because the page markets *this* product. A clone serving it
is telling a stranger about a CRM that stranger is already running, under
somebody else's name; and on an internal install there is no stranger to tell,
only a rep who signed out and wants the sign-in box.

- **Only the literal `true` turns it on**, which is the same shape as
  `PRISMA_LOG_QUERIES`. A flag with several truthy spellings is a flag that is
  set and not working.
- **It decides one thing: what a stranger at `/` is shown.** Anyone signed in is
  sent to their workspace by the proxy either way, and no other route changes —
  the landing page's own components are still built and still reachable from a
  deploy that sets the flag.
- **The read is live.** `isMarketing()` in `apps/app/lib/env.ts` reads
  `process.env` per request rather than at import: `proxy.ts` runs in Next's
  Node runtime, so the value comes from the environment the server is running
  in, not from the one it was built in. Declared in `apps/app/turbo.json` under
  `passThroughEnv` for both `dev` and `build`, because Turbo runs in strict env
  mode.

See [the proxy rules](./api.md#there-is-exactly-one-organization-and-it-is-not-a-tenancy-boundary)
for where it sits among the other gates.

## Where things are

`API_URL` and `APP_URL` default to `http://localhost:3001` and
`http://localhost:3000`. Set them for any real deployment.

- **`API_URL`** is the origin that mints session cookies and serves
  `/api/auth/*`. `next.config.ts` republishes it as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, which
  is what the browser's auth client and tRPC proxy use — so one variable
  configures both sides. `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is still read as a fallback because
  Better Auth's own tooling looks for it, but `API_URL` is the name to use.
- **`APP_URL`** is where the browser is, and it is also the trusted-origin
  allow-list: the set of origins allowed to call the API with credentials, and
  the list Better Auth validates post-sign-in `callbackURL`s against.
  Comma-separate if the app is genuinely served from more than one origin; the
  first is canonical. This replaced a separate `AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, which
  could only ever disagree with it.
- **`AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`** only when the API and the app are on different
  subdomains of one parent — then `.example.com`, so one cookie covers both. On
  localhost the shared cookie already works, because cookies ignore ports.

### The session cookie is named after this app, not after the library

`AUTH_COOKIE_PREFIX` in [`@crm/auth/cookies`](../packages/auth/src/cookies.ts)
is the literal string `crm`, so the session cookie is
`__Secure-crm.session_token` rather than Better Auth's default
`__Secure-better-auth.session_token`.

The default is a hazard for any install whose app shares a parent domain with
something else — `crm.example.com` beside an existing `app.example.com`. A
cookie set with `Domain=.example.com` by the neighbour is sent to *us* too,
under a name identical to ours, and `parseCookies` keeps one value per name. The
failure is silent and reads as a deployment problem rather than a naming one:
sign-in completes, the `session` row is written with a week's expiry, the
browser holds a cookie, and then every reader — the API that minted it and the
app alike — resolves it to `null` and bounces to `/sign-in`. Nothing logs an
error, because nothing has errored.

Two things follow. It is set on the **server config and the proxy's read**
together: `advanced.cookiePrefix` in `auth.ts` names the cookie and
`getSessionCookie(request, { cookiePrefix: AUTH_COOKIE_PREFIX })` in
`apps/app/proxy.ts` looks for it, and a prefix changed in one place only is a
gate that redirects every signed-in request. And **changing it signs everybody
out** — the old cookies stop matching. That is a one-time cost paid on deploy,
not a loop: a stale `better-auth`-prefixed cookie no longer matches, so the
proxy sends the reader to `/sign-in`, which is where they need to be.
- **`AGENT_URL`** is the research agent, which is its own deployment. The app
  reads it to proxy the bridge and the API reads it to poke the dispatcher, both
  server-side only: the browser never learns the agent has an origin of its own.
  It must be a whole URL including the scheme, and the API validates that at
  boot — `new URL("/internal/crm/dispatch", base)` throws on `127.0.0.1:2000`,
  and it would throw at the moment a task is queued rather than at startup. See
  [the agent bridge](./agent.md#the-bridge).

## Typed, validated env

`apps/api/src/config/env.validation.ts` is a `class-validator` schema run by
`ConfigModule.forRoot({ validate })`, so the API fails at boot with a named
error rather than at three in the morning with `undefined`. It lists every
variable the API reads and nothing else — a variable that exists but is never
read is a question a self-hoster has to answer for no reason.

Two sharp edges:

- **Validation runs while `AppModule` is being evaluated.** A test that needs to
  set a variable has to do it before importing that module — see the dynamic
  `import()` in `apps/api/test/auth.e2e.spec.ts`.
- **The schema is the API's, not the repo's.** `@crm/auth` and the agent read
  their own values directly, because they run in processes Nest does not own.

## Optional: what the agent can do

Every outside source the agent can reach is optional, and it is designed to run
with none of them. A missing key removes a place to look; it is never an error.

The company research key is the exception and it is **not in this table**,
because it is not a variable at all — see
[the next section](#the-context-key-is-asked-for-not-configured).

| Variable | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | Open-web research with citations, and the search that finds a LinkedIn slug |
| `RAPIDAPI_KEY` | LinkedIn profiles via LinkDAPI — name, title, employer, tenure |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Raises the GitHub rate limit from 60/hour when matching profiles |
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Mirrors every logo and profile picture into Vercel Blob rather than linking them. Read by the API and the seed too — see below |
| `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | The model. Not needed on Vercel, where OIDC handles it |
| `AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET` | Lets a rep talk to the agent from the contact sheet — [the bridge](./agent.md#the-bridge) |

`apps/agent/agent/lib/capabilities.ts` is the single place that knows which are
set. It prints the list at startup, states it in the session instructions so the
agent plans around what it actually has, and gives the tools a shared
"not configured, and retrying will not help" result — checked *before* the
research budget is charged, so an install without a key does not pay for the
discovery on every contact.

### The Context key is asked for, not configured

**`CONTEXT_DEV_API_KEY` is not a variable in this repo, and adding one back
would be a second answer to a question that already has one.** Nothing reads it
— not `.env.example`, not `env.validation.ts`, not any `turbo.json`. The key
lives in `AppSetting` beside the agent's model, it is asked for at
`/onboarding/research`, and **Settings → General** changes it afterwards.

Same reason as [SSO](./api.md#sso-is-a-row-not-a-deployment): an admin who
cannot redeploy cannot set an environment variable. It goes further than SSO
does, because this is not a key an install can sensibly do without — it decides
whether a company arrives as itself or as a grey square with its initials in
it — so [the proxy asks for it](./api.md#the-gate-is-proxyts-and-it-is-answered-once-per-browser)
rather than leaving it to be discovered on a settings page nobody visits.

- **An install that had the variable set is asked for the key again, and that
  is the intended upgrade.** Nothing adopts the old value — no boot-time
  migration, no fallback — so the first navigation after deploying lands
  everyone on `/onboarding/research`, where they paste the key they already
  have. It is one interruption, once, in exchange for the answer living in one
  place rather than two — and it cannot be dismissed, because a dismissed gate
  is an install quietly filling up with companies that have no logo.
- **Nothing is lost in the meantime, and the wait is not a queue.** A `brand`
  task with nowhere to look is consumed and marked done — but it settles
  `SKIPPED` *before* anything marks the row `RUNNING`, and `settle` only writes
  over a `RUNNING` row, so the company stays `PENDING`. `PENDING` is exactly
  what the sign-in sweep re-queues, so the work is recovered from the record
  rather than held in the queue. `test/keyless-brand.integration.spec.ts` pins
  it, because a `settle` that wrote unconditionally would strand every company
  added before the key with nothing to say so.
- **Saving the key picks that work up immediately.**
  `settings.setResearchKey` runs the company sweep itself rather than leaving it
  to the next sign-in, because the person who just fixed it is standing there.
  It is fire-and-forget: a sweep that fails logs and the sign-in one still
  catches up. Contacts are not swept here — only one of the three portrait
  sources is Context — and they are picked up on the next sign-in as before.
- **`readContextDevKey` in [`@crm/db/settings`](../packages/db/src/settings.ts)
  is the only reader**, and it reads one column. Everything downstream —
  `contextDevKey()` in the agent's `capabilities.ts`, the client in
  `lib/context-dev.ts`, the API's `settings.researchKey` — goes through it, so
  there is exactly one place that knows where the key is kept.
- **It is read live, not at boot.** There is no cache in front of it, so a key
  pasted into the settings page applies to the very next vendor call rather than
  to the next deployment. Each read is one indexed row in front of a lookup that
  is about to make an HTTP request anyway.
- **A database that cannot be read is a capability that is off**, not an
  exception. `contextDevKey()` logs and returns null, because a missing source
  must never throw — the rule at the top of this section, and the reason the
  agent keeps running against everything else it has.
- **The key is never read back.** The API returns whether one is set and its
  last four characters, and nothing returns the key itself. Same rule as an SSO
  client secret.
- **A wrong key is refused at the point it is typed, and the agent is what
  checks it.** Checking means calling Context, and [a vendor client in the API
  is a bug](./api.md#intelligence-never-lives-in-the-api) — so
  `settings.setResearchKey` asks the agent over the bridge
  (`POST /internal/crm/verify-key`) and only writes the row if the answer is not
  *invalid*. The agent already owns the client, the error classification and the
  key, so nothing about Context.dev is learned twice.
  - **The probe costs nothing.** A brand lookup only bills when it resolves a
    brand, and a free-provider address is refused with a documented `422`
    before any resolution — so `key-check@gmail.com` reaches Context, proves
    the key authenticates, and is never billed. Measured at about half a second.
  - **`401` is the only answer that means the key is wrong.** A `403` about the
    plan, a `422` refusing the probe, a `429`, a `500` — all of those were
    served *after* the key authenticated, so the key is good and only the probe
    was refused. `classifyKey` in `lib/context-dev.ts` holds that rule and
    `test/verify-key.spec.ts` pins every branch of it.
  - **A check that cannot be made is not a failed check.** No
    `AGENT_BRIDGE_SECRET`, an agent that is down, a timeout — all return
    `unknown`, and an unknown answer *saves the key* and logs that it went in
    unverified. The alternative is an install whose agent is not up yet being
    unable to finish onboarding, which is a worse failure than an unchecked
    key: the key is still checked by the first task that uses it.

`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is the one entry in that table the agent does not own
alone, which is why it is also declared in `apps/api/src/config/env.validation.ts`
and in `apps/api/turbo.json`. The API writes two pictures of its own — the
favicon a domain serves, and the Google avatar of anyone who signs in — and
`packages/db/prisma/seed.ts` writes fifteen. The Next.js app is deliberately
*not* on that list: it only has to recognise one of our URLs to route it through
the image optimizer, and recognising one needs no token. See
[the agent's picture rules](./agent.md#pictures-are-copied-never-linked).

## Gmail and Calendar sync

Always on. Same OAuth client, same callback — the two read-only scopes are added
to the existing Google provider rather than to a second one, so there is no
extra redirect URI to register.

The scopes are requested **at sign-in** and are a condition of using the CRM
*for the person who signed in with Google*: `requireGoogleAccess()` gates the
app shell on what Google actually granted, because granular consent lets a user
untick a scope and still complete sign-in. Anyone missing either scope is sent
to `/grant-access` to re-consent.

**Someone who signed in through an identity provider is not gated**, and the
distinction is the whole of `needsGoogleGrant` in
[`@crm/auth`](../packages/auth/src/scopes.ts): the wall applies to an account
whose only sign-in row is `google`. Two reasons it cannot be "does this person
have the scopes".

- **An SSO rep has no Google account to grant them on.** Sending them to
  `/grant-access` is sending them to a page whose only other button is *sign
  out* — a locked door with a sign on it, on an install that may have no Google
  client at all.
- **Linking Gmail must not become a trap.** An SSO rep who connects Google and
  later revokes it would, under a scopes-only rule, be locked out of the CRM by
  having tried the optional feature. `revoke()` clears the tokens and keeps the
  `account` row, so that row is exactly what a scopes-only rule would trip over.

They connect it from **Settings → Connections** instead, which posts the same
`linkSocial` call `/grant-access` does — one write path, two doors. The card
tells the three states apart, because they need three different sentences: no
Google client on the install, a client but no linked account, and a linked
account that has stopped working.

**Sync is forward-only.** Nothing from before a mailbox was first seen is
imported: Gmail records the current `historyId` on its first pass and imports
nothing, and Calendar reads from `now` onwards.

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CRON_SECRET` | in deployed environments | Bearer guard on `POST /internal/sync/google`. Vercel sends it automatically as `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`. Minimum 16 characters; the route **fails closed** if unset, so locally the cron simply never runs. |

The absences are deliberate:

- **No `GOOGLE_SYNC_ENABLED`.** A feature flag earns its keep when it gates
  something that can genuinely be absent — `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` does, because
  without a key there is no call to make. Sync has everything it needs the
  moment the app boots. A switch that can turn off a mandatory feature,
  defaulting to off, is a switch that is only ever wrong.
- **No `GOOGLE_WORKSPACE_DOMAIN`.** `ALLOWED_SIGN_IN` already says who is
  internal, and it is seeded into the sync's "us" set alongside the `User`
  table. Two sources for one fact is how a colleague becomes a lead.
- **No `GMAIL_BACKFILL_DAYS`.** There is no backfill.

Two things to do in Google Cloud before this works:

- **Enable the Gmail API and the Google Calendar API** on the project.
- **Set the consent screen to User type: Internal** if you are on Google
  Workspace. `gmail.readonly` is a *restricted* scope; an External app using it
  needs OAuth verification plus an annual CASA security assessment, while an
  Internal app needs no further review. Going External later means the full
  review, so this is a decision, not a checkbox.

The cron is declared in `apps/api/vercel.json` at `*/5 * * * *`. Minute-level
schedules need a Pro plan; on Hobby it silently becomes daily.

## Database

Prisma is driven through turbo from the repo root: `db:generate`, `db:migrate`,
`db:push`, `db:reset`, `db:seed`, `db:studio`, `db:deploy`. Config lives in
`packages/db/prisma.config.ts`, which loads the root `.env` itself, so the CLI
works without any app running.

## What is not an env var

- **Cache TTL default** — `DEFAULT_TTL_MS` (60s) is a constant in
  `apps/api/src/cache/cache.module.ts`. `CACHE_TTL_MS` only overrides it.
- **Redis** — optional. Without `REDIS_URL` the cache falls back to a
  per-instance in-memory store, which is fine for local work and wrong for any
  multi-instance deploy (see `docs/api.md`).
- **Sign-in method** — Google is the built-in one and it is in code. An
  install that wants its own identity provider adds one on the SSO settings
  page, and that is a row rather than a variable — see
  [SSO](./api.md#sso-is-a-row-not-a-deployment).

## `vercel env pull` writes to `.env.local`, which wins

The two conventions collide, and the collision is quiet:

- `.env.local` is the *local override* file, so the loader reads it **after**
  `.env` and it wins.
- `vercel env pull` writes **production** credentials into that same file by
  default — database, auth secret, OAuth client, Blob, Redis, the lot.

Pull once and every process in the repo silently points at production. The
symptom is not an error; it is `bun run dev` working perfectly against the live
database, and `prisma migrate dev` in `packages/db` applying migrations to it.
That happened here on 2026-08-01: eleven migrations landed on Neon from a
laptop, and only the backfill in `20260801140000_contact_intelligence` kept it
from dropping three columns of real data.

Two defences, and you want both:

1. **Pull somewhere inert.** `vercel env pull .env.vercel` — the loader does not
   read it, so it is reference material rather than configuration.
2. **The destructive `db:*` scripts refuse a non-local host.**
   `packages/db/scripts/require-local-db.ts` guards `db:migrate`, `db:push`,
   `db:reset` and `db:seed`, prints which file the URL came from, and takes
   `ALLOW_REMOTE_DB=1` when you mean it. `db:deploy` is deliberately unguarded —
   pointing that at a remote database is what it is for.

The guard resolves the URL by reading the root files directly, in the loader's
order, rather than trusting `process.env`. That is not fussiness: Bun
auto-loads the `.env` in the *working directory* before running a script, while
Prisma's CLI is a Node process that only sees `@crm/env/load`. The first version
of the guard read `process.env`, saw the `packages/db/.env` copy, and waved the
Neon case through. A guard that is wrong in that direction is worse than none.

## Secrets hygiene

The root `.gitignore` ignores `.env` and `.env.*` with a single negation for
`.env.example`, so a backup like `.env.bak` or `.env.old` is ignored too rather
than committed by a stray `git add -A`. `.env.example` is the only env file in
the repository, and it ships no value that is a secret — the placeholders are
empty strings, and `packages/env/test/root.spec.ts` asserts that they stay that
way.

Generate your own secret. Never reuse one from an example file, a tutorial, or
another environment: `openssl rand -base64 32`.
