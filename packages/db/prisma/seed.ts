/**
 * A believable pipeline to develop against: real domains so the enrichment
 * agent has something to look up, deals spread across every stage, and tasks
 * that are genuinely overdue.
 *
 * Idempotent — companies key off `domain`, contacts off `email`, and deals off
 * a deterministic id — so re-running tops the data up rather than duplicating
 * it. Randomness comes from a seeded generator for the same reason: two runs
 * produce the same pipeline.
 *
 * Users are the exception. Better Auth owns them, and a row written here has no
 * Google account attached — but account linking is enabled for Google, so
 * signing in with a matching address adopts the row rather than creating a
 * second one. Real users are used when they exist; the placeholders below are
 * only created when the table is empty.
