# Identity matching

You are given an email address and a company. You need the person. Getting this
wrong writes a stranger's career onto a customer's record, so the procedure is
built to fail closed.

## Why the obvious approach does not work

`pmarchetti@fernhill.com` is not a name. Searching for it directly returns nothing.
Asking a model what it stands for produces "Paula Marchetti" — which happens to be
right, and would have been just as confident had it been wrong. You cannot tell
the difference afterwards, which is why guessing is banned outright.

What works is decomposition: `pmarchetti` contains the surname `marchetti`, and
searching *that* alongside the company returns `linkedin.com/in/paulamarchetti`
as the first result. The guess went into the **query**, and the answer came from
the profile.

That is the shape of every match: guess where to look, never what you will find.

## The procedure

0. **`read_crm_history` first.** It is free and it is often decisive. If they
   have ever replied to us from that address, you already have the strongest
   evidence available anywhere — `crm.thread-reply` — and a signature block may
   hand you their title as well. Start every match here, not at a search engine.
1. **`resolve_linkedin_profile`** with the email and company. It decomposes the
   local part and returns candidate slugs. These are leads, not answers.
2. **`get_linkedin_profile`** on each candidate, passing the email, company name
   and domain — **and the `contactId`**. It returns the profile *and a verdict*.
   Passing the id is what lets it copy their photograph, which it does only if
   the verdict comes back positive, in code, without asking you. Leaving it out
   costs the contact their picture and saves nothing.
3. **Read the verdict, not the profile.** It checks two things:
   - `employerMatches` — a current position matches the company we have.
   - `nameMatches` — the real name is consistent with the email local part
     (`y` + `okonkwo` → Tomi Okonkwo).
4. **Both, or it is not them.** One of the two is not a weaker match, it is a
   different person who happens to share something.
5. If no candidate passes, **stop**. Leaving "Pmarchetti" in the CRM is the correct
   outcome when you do not know.

Somebody whose LinkedIn URL is **already on the record** has been through all of
this before. Do not re-run it to get a picture — `fetch_contact_photo` is one
call, and the URL sitting there is the verification.

## Reporting the match

Call `identify_contact` with what you actually saw:

| What you have | Evidence to record | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Both checks pass | `linkedin.employer-and-name` | Written to the record. |
| They replied from that address | `crm.thread-reply` | Written to the record. |
| One check passes | `employer-only`, or the profile as `search.cites-profile` | Offered to a rep as a suggestion. |
| Sources disagree | add a `contradiction` entry | Held. Nobody is shown a guess. |

The middle row is the case this exists for. Four Marchettis work at Fernhill; a
human settles that in three seconds, and the old rule — throw away anything
short of certain — meant we paid for that lookup every run and learned nothing
from it. A suggestion is not a failed match. It is the match, handed to the one
person who can finish it.

Do not add evidence you did not observe to push a claim over a line.

## Things that look like evidence and are not

- **A search result.** Search says where to look. A query for "Paula Marchetti"
  once returned Brightwater's CEO, an HR lead at Reply, and a data engineer in
  Seattle — all with total confidence.
- **A matching first name.** Half the Chrises at a company are not your Chris.
  The surname or the employer has to carry it.
- **Perplexity's view of somebody's job title.** It aggregates stale sources; it
  said "Account Executive L3" for a profile that reads "Growth Specialist at
  Fernhill". For identity, the person's own profile wins.
- **A very plausible expansion.** `jsmith` is probably J. Smith. Probably is not
  a source.

## When the person genuinely is not findable

Some people have no profile, or a profile with no employer, or a name that
cannot be reconciled with their address. Say so plainly and move on. A contact
that keeps its placeholder name is a contact a human can fix in five seconds; a
contact with the wrong person's job history is one nobody knows to fix.
